# vocabUpdates
This repo allows you to add new ontologies to be included in http://vocab.linkeddata.es

Steps for adding a new vocabulary

1) add a new line to the Vocabularies.csv file with the format: URI;{list of domains, comma separated}

2) make pull request or commit to the develop branch

3) wait for some VIP to accept it


You can check the log at: http://54.88.191.135/jarsomatic/getlog (this will be changed to jarsomatic.linkeddata.es) (or ask Ahmad who is the only one who can understand the logs)

Check here XXXXXXXXXXXXXX whether the new site is ok before making the pull request to master (so that it is updated in vocab.linkeddata.es)
